Fresh Strawberries  Sugar To Taste (optional - berries vary from year to year. If they're really sweet you many not need any but if you want the syrupy nectar to drizzle over the top you'll need to mix in some sugar as that draws out the natural fruit juice)  1 to 2 oz strawberry rum  Light whipped creme, Cool whip (French Vanilla flavor is super yummy) vanilla or strawberry ice cream (whichever you prefer)  Preheat oven to 325.  Spray a tube pan with Pam Cooking Spray.  Rub in with fingers especially if using a fluted pan.  You want to make sure that all the surface is coated so the cake won't stick.  Cream butter well.  Gradually add sugar and blend until smooth.  Add eggs one at a time, beating after each addition.  Add sour cream and mix well.  Beat in flour.  Then add flavoring.  Pour into pan and bake for 60 to 75 minutes or until a cake tester comes out clean.  Leave in pan for 10 minutes.  Then remove to a cooling rack.  As with any cake you're supposed to allow it to cool before slicing but I love a piece when the top is slightly crusty and the inside is soft,warm and that vanilla, buttery aroma steams up to your nose with each bite!  In your kitchen you make and break the rules.  Just enjoy!  For the topping, slice strawberries.  Sprinkle with sugar.  Pour in rum.  Stir and let sit for 1 to 2 hours so juices release and alcohol soaks into he berries.  Slice cake layers.  Top with strawberries and whipped creme!"

Optional  I also plated some of the Sashimi on crisp Romaine Lettuce leaves and topped that with slices of Avocado.  As well, while shopping at the Japanese Grocery store I saw vacuum packed Tempura which are ready to fry.  I bought this on a lark to see the taste and when fried a la minute (to order) it was really tasty.  Remember frying oil must be between 300-350 to get the crispiness quickly so that your Tempura does not soak up the oil  ***I have a fear of tapeworm - an illogical fear.  Before I make any uncooked fish at home whether for Sashimi or Sushi I freeze my fish overnight or longer.  Then I defrost it and use it raw.  The freezing kills the Parasites that cause tapeworm.  I don't even trust my fishmonger - as I said it is an illogical fear."

Do not use dried parsley.  Then put the parsley in a large mixing bowl.  Then cut onion up into pieces - doesn't matter how small just so you can fit it into the chopper and combine the garlic and chop away until fine - not pasty though.  Put the onion garlic mixture in the bowl with the parsley and add ground meat and spices.  Mix with hands until everything is well blended.  Pat the meat mixture down in the bottom of a 9x13 baking pan and broil in oven until top is browned, this will enhance the flavor, then take out of the oven.  Peel potatoes.  Slice tomatoes and potatoes into quarter of an inch in size and layer - potatoes first and then tomatoes will be top layer.  Sprinkle with a little salt-and bake in oven about 425 degF covered with foil for approximately 45 minutes to and hour - enjoy."

This can be done with water and veggie stock or with spray-type coatings.  Dump everything else in and bring to a low boil.  Simmer until you like the texture.  The hominy should be really soft, almost to the break-up-and-really-form-a-thick-stew stage.  Please consider your tolerance for spices.  The heat will come from the green chiles and the chile powder, as well as the black pepper.  Finally, if you want a little more color in the stew, you could throw in some kernel corn."

For cooking vegetables it's a good method, as it leaves you clean grilled taste A charcoal grill may end up overpowering the dish with a smoky flavor.  Slice the zucchini into 1/2 inch discs.  Get a good sized piece of tinfoil.  Spray it with a non-stick spray.  Add the zucchini, tomatoes, garlic, oil, salt and pepper.  Toss all the ingredients together, I use my clean hands, or use tongs.  Try not to rip the tinfoil in the process!  Bring the left and right edges of the tinfoil together and fold them together, two or three times, to seal .  Now fold the top and bottom edges together to created a nicely sealed packet.  The sealed packet will make the veggies all steam together nicely.  Turn the grill down to medium.  Put the packet on the grill, cover, and cook for 10 minutes.  With a spatula or tongs, turn the packet over and cook an additional 10 minutes.  After those ten minutes, open the packet and top with feta and mint.  Close the packet back up and let cook an addition 2-3 minutes, until the cheese is a bit melty and the mint is fragrant.  Serve!"

Wrap the Salmon filet with the plastic wrap.  Make sure it is wrapped from all sides tightly.  Place the heavy object on top of it to weigh it down.  - Place in the fridge for 3 days.  - On the third day, take it out of the fridge, discard of the citrus fruits slices and fennel slices.  Rinse the Salmon fillet under cold water thoroughly from both sides and pat dry with paper towels.  The filet should feel firm but not hard.  Slice thin and serve in a platter.

Mix well with a table knife to incorporate the dough.  Transfer to a clean surface and knead until smooth.  This will take around 4-6 minutes.  Dust some flour to the board to eliminate sticking to it.  Brush the surface of the dough with a little olive oil and placed on a clean oiled bowl.  Cover with saran wrap and let it rise in a warm place until it doubles in size, about 1 hour.  Grease a large baking tray.  Scoop gently the dough from the bowl and place it onto the prepared baking tray.  Flatten gently the dough to shape into a rectangle and spray or brush lightly with more oil.

Stir in yoghurt and cornmeal and pour into greased, lined tin.  Bake for 45 minutes in preheated oven, or until a fine skewer comes out clean.  Cool a little before turning out.  Cut into squares to serve with meat and salad.  Cold cornbread can be fried quickly on both sides and served as a base for grilled meat.  It is possible to substitute pumpkin for sweet potato, but it must be a dry pumpkin."

Do not over blend the kiwifruits, otherwise seeds will be crushed and make popsicles bitter.  Pour out blended gold kiwifruits into a cup and set aside.  Then blend the green kiwifruits.  Carefully pour half blended kiwifruits into silicone individual moulds (6 gold kiwifruits and 6 green kiwifruits as I wanted to make a two tones colour in one popsicle).

Place 1 tablespoon of butter into a saute pan.  Add the mushrooms and onions, and cook over medium heat until the onions are translucent.  Add in another 4 tablespoons butter, the garlic, and the flour, and stir until all the lumps of flour are gone.  Remove from heat and set aside.  Preheat a large skillet over medium-high heat with the oil in the pan.  While it is preheating, slice your steak across the grain, and sprinkle with salt and pepper.  Place into the hot pan, and cook for 3-4 minutes allowing each side to develop some color.  Cook egg noodles in boiling water until al dente.  Drain and set aside.  Deglaze the pan with the sherry and beef broth, add back in the mushroom/onion/flour mix, and stir to combine the sauce.  Let simmer until thickened.  Remove from heat, and place 1/2 cup of the sauce into a separate bowl with the sour cream.  Mix to combine, and then stir that mixture into the dish.  This will temper the sour cream so it doesn't break in the hot sauce.  Serve over egg noodles, and enjoy!"

Cut each banana in 4 chunks.  Place bananas and marshmallows on skewars.  Either cook over a fire or place on a grill rack.  Bananas will take longer than the marshmallows to cook.  You know they are done when the skin begins to break away from the fruit.  Remove skins from bananas and place 4 pieces onto Snickerdoodle cookies or Graham crackers.  Top with toasted marshmallow, chocolate drops and fruit.  You can make a sandwich with two pieces or have a messy feast with one."

Bring up to a simmer for 10-20 minutes depending on size of the pears.  When a fork slips into pears easily remove from heat & allow to cool in liquid.  Once tepid - place the pears in to the fridge, leaving the juices in the pan.  Continue cooking the liquid until reduced by half and forms a syrup.  Taste the syrup - if its tart add a bit more sugar.  Allow the syrup to cool once desired consistency is achieved.  Strain out aromatics.  Server syrup drizzled over pears with a scoop of gelato or whip cream!"

Coating:  1/2 cup of flour  1/2 cup cornmeal  2 eggs  Vegetable oil - for frying  Stuffing:  Healthy handful of fresh Italian parsley  5 - Sun dried tomatoes  1/4 cup grated Romano cheese  5 cloves of garlic  4 slices of bread - toasted  Olive oil - a drizzle  Place all of the ingredients for the stuffing in a food processor and give a few good chops, leaving the stuffing slightly coarse.  Carefully slice a pocket in the pork chop for stuffing.  In a shallow dish combine the flour and cornmeal and in another shallow bowl the egg -wash.  Dip the pork chops first in the cornmeal-flour and then in the egg-wash and back in the cornmeal-flour dish.  Next fill each chop using a teaspoon.  Heat a large frying pan with about one inch of vegetable oil.  Carefully, place the prepared pork chops in the hot oil.  Turn the chops only once to cook on each side to a beautiful golden color.  You may finish cooking the chops in a 350 degree oven, after both sides are golden, for a few minutes."

Grease pan lightly & heat pan.  Put in the fishes & close the lid.  When steam comes out of pan, flip it over.  Open lid to check to ensure fishes are in place & browning.  Close lid & flip it back after about 4-5mins.  Fish is completely cooked if your fork goes thru the meat easily.  Remove & top with the 3 types of chilli & you'll get a tender fish dish with crispy skin!  While hubby & I thought the Sambal would be the best match for the fishes but Tom Yam turned out to be the best.  So take your pick & choose your favourite toppings!"

In a small bowl, combine oregano, thyme, paprika, cayenne, black pepper, sugar, cumin, salt, garlic powder, onion powder, Tabasco sauce, and oil; mix well into a paste.  Line a large baking sheet with aluminum foil; pour a small amount of oil onto foil and spread with a paper towel.  Peel potatoes and slice into french fry shapes.  Place fries in a plastic bag with paste and work paste onto fries; alternatively you can do this in a bowl, but the bag method is easier.  Place fries on lined baking sheet, trying not to let edges touch.  Bake in preheated oven for approximately 30 - 35 minutes (your time may vary with the size fry you cut); turn once during cooking to brown underside."

You will also need to add 2 cups of warm water.  Simmer in medium heat for about 20-25 minutes and then incorporate the chopped herbs.  If you wish you can add the grated feta inside the rice so it 'll become more edgy and creamy but I prefer to to add the feta over the rice after serving!"

Cut the ends off the eggplant then cut the eggplant lengthwise.  Spray a baking sheet with cooking spray and lay the eggplant pieces cut-side-down on the sheet; bake the eggplant in the oven for 45 minutes.  While eggplant is baking, grate half of the onion (you want the grated texture and intense flavor of the onion juice without the chopped texture) and chop the other half.  When the eggplant is done, take one half and simply scoop out the soft inner parts; the other half you want to cut into chunky cubes (you can leave the peel on or not- it's up to you- but i removed it); turn off the oven.  In a food processor, put half of the white beans, half of the chopped basil, the chopped onion (not the grated half), the garlic, half of the chopped scallions, and the half of the eggplant that you scooped out; whir the mixture until it is smooth.  Put the processed mixture in a crock pot and add the remaining ingredients (including the other half of the divided items), and heat on low for 2 hours; alternately you could simmer it on the stove for 30 minutes.  This is a very rich-tasting soup, so smallish servings can be a good idea."

Boil the green beans until tender, about 5 minutes.  Transfer them to the ice bath and chill for 3 to 4 minutes.  Remove the beans to a paper lined bowl.  Boil the corn for 2 minutes, and then immerse the ears in the ice bath until completely chilled, about 5 minutes.  Add more ice cubes to the ice bath as needed.

Cook until the liquid is reduced by half and the tomatoes are nearly broken down, about 5 minutes.  Add the pasta to the skillet along with the cooked sausage and the remaining butter and cook stirring until the pasta is well coated.  Remove from the heat and stir in the shredded provolone cheese.  Transfer to bowls and serve right the way."

When the water reboils, reduce the heat to a simmer and let cook, partially covered, for 2 hours.  Stir it from time to time.  Stir in the rest of the ingredients (except the kielbasa) and simmer for 30 more minutes, stirring from time to time.  Remove the ham hock, cut away the meat, and return it to the pot with the kielbasa.  Simmer for a couple of hours.  Although the soup is now done and can be eaten, best is to leave it overnight and gently reheat the next day.  Eat with dark, heavy bread."

        "text": " couple of pounds of Halibut  enough cooking oil to allow deep frying  1 cup flour  one 12-ounce bottle of  beer  1 tbsp Of paprika and 1 1/2 tsp  salt  For this batter, good quality, light-colored beers work best.  The flavor of dark beers is too strong.  Cut Halibut into 1-inch-thick chunks.  Heat oil in a deep-fat fryer to 375 degF.  Make batter by combining remaining ingredients.  Dip the Halibut into the batter and drop the pieces into the hot oil a few at a time.  Cook the fish chunks until the batter is golden brown ~ just a few minutes.  Halibut overcooks easily, so try not to overdo it.  Remove the fish pieces from the oil and drain on paper towels; serve piping hot with your favorite accompaniments."

Put a pot of water to boil.  Once boiling, salt the water and add the pasta.  Cook until the pasta is al dente.  Set aside.  While the pasta is cooking, pour the milk in a microwave safe bowl and pop in the microwave for about 1 minute.  Set aside.  Meanwhile, in another saucepot, melt the butter over low heat.  Add in the garlic and crushed red pepper.  Cook for a minute or so.  Slowly add in the flour while whisking to ensure that there are no lumps.  Cook for about 1-2 minutes.  Gradually add the milk and keep whisking because the mixture will thicken quickly until all the milk is added.  Keep whisking until the flour/butter is mixed completely into the milk and there are no lumps.  Add in the 2 1/2 tsp of salt, 1 tsp of ground black pepper, oregano, parsley, and the cream cheese.  Cook over medium heat until the mixture has thickened.  While the sauce is thickening, saute the onions and mushrooms over medium heat with a little olive oil for about 3-4 minutes.  Add the spinach to the pan and season with 1/2 tsp salt and a pinch black pepper.  Continue to cook until the spinach has wilted.  Add in the chopped tomatoes and cook for another minute.  Add in the sauteed vegetables into the cream and stir.  Add in the pasta and stir until the pasta is evenly coated.  Pour into a large greased baking pan, cover with foil and cook for 20 minutes.

Meanwhile, cook bacon in a skillet over medium heat until crisp, turning frequently.  Remove bacon to a stack of paper towels to drain.  Crumble bacon.  Remove all but 2 T of bacon drippings from the pan.  Return the pan to medium heat.  Add the green onions and broccoli, stirring frequently for about 3-5 minutes or until crisp-tender.  Add zucchini and 2 T of pesto, tossing to combine all ingredients.  Taste and add more pesto, if needed.  The mixture only needs to warm up, so 2-3 minutes of cooking ought to do it.
