In your kitchen you make and break the rules.  Just enjoy!  For the topping, slice strawberries.  Sprinkle with sugar.  Pour in rum.

Once you are finished browning the meat, lay the roasts down in the cooker and pour the teriyaki sauce over the top.  Close and seal the lid and set the pot to manual and 20 minutes of cook time.  Allow the pot to release pressure naturally, and then remove the lid and slice the meat.  Serve with jasmine rice and steamed broccoli.  Garnish with toasted sesame seeds and chopped green onions."

If you like raisins, you can combine it with the dough now.  Divide the dough into 16 pieces and roll each piece into a ball.  Put each ball on a cookie sheet and bake at 350 degrees F for 25 minutes.  Let the cookies cool for about 20 minutes.  Dust with powdered sugar before serving."

In the morning, drain the beans, rinse them under cold running water, and place them in a saucepan with fresh water to cover.  Bring to a boil over high heat, then reduce the heat and simmer several hours until the beans are soft and the skins begin to split.  Add water when necessary to keep the beans from drying, and stir occasionally to prevent them from burning and sticking.  Remove from the heat, drain, and allow to cool.  In a bowl, toss together the greens, beans and rice.  Cover and chill in the refrigerator at least 30 minutes.  In a blender, combine the oil, vinegar, chives, garlic, pepper, and salt.

        "text": " e  g  g  s  Room temperature eggs are the most ideal for boiling.  Do not add salt to water.  The salt raises the boiling point of the water which leads to rubbery eggs.  The eggs must not be stacked but be in one layer only.  Gently place the eggs in a single layer in a pan or pot with enough cold water to cover eggs completely by about an inch.  As soon as the water reaches a rapid boil, remove pan from heat and cover egg pan tightly with a lid."

Butter a 20 cm (9 inch) cake tin.  Blend sweet potato, butter, eggs, sugar, baking soda, salt and cinnamon in a food processor until smooth.  Stir in yoghurt and cornmeal and pour into greased, lined tin.  Bake for 45 minutes in preheated oven, or until a fine skewer comes out clean.  Cool a little before turning out.  Cut into squares to serve with meat and salad.  Cold cornbread can be fried quickly on both sides and served as a base for grilled meat.  It is possible to substitute pumpkin for sweet potato, but it must be a dry pumpkin."

Place 1 tablespoon of butter into a saute pan.  Add the mushrooms and onions, and cook over medium heat until the onions are translucent.  Add in another 4 tablespoons butter, the garlic, and the flour, and stir until all the lumps of flour are gone.  Remove from heat and set aside.  Preheat a large skillet over medium-high heat with the oil in the pan.  While it is preheating, slice your steak across the grain, and sprinkle with salt and pepper.  Place into the hot pan, and cook for 3-4 minutes allowing each side to develop some color.  Cook egg noodles in boiling water until al dente.  Drain and set aside.  Deglaze the pan with the sherry and beef broth, add back in the mushroom/onion/flour mix, and stir to combine the sauce.  Let simmer until thickened.  Remove from heat, and place 1/2 cup of the sauce into a separate bowl with the sour cream.  Mix to combine, and then stir that mixture into the dish.  This will temper the sour cream so it doesn't break in the hot sauce.  Serve over egg noodles, and enjoy!"

        "text": " 1 large globe eggplant, divided  1 medium yellow onion, divided  2 teaspoons minced garlic  2 scallions, chopped and divided  1 (15 ounces) can white beans, divided  1/4 cup chopped fresh basil, divided  1/4 cup diced roasted red peppers  1 (15 ounces) can coconut milk  1 cup vegetable broth or chicken broth  1 tablespoon dry sherry  2 teaspoons Braggs liquid aminos or 1 teaspoon soy sauce  1 teaspoon fish sauce (optional if you don't have it, but it adds nice flavor)  Preheat oven to 350 degF.  Cut the ends off the eggplant then cut the eggplant lengthwise.  Spray a baking sheet with cooking spray and lay the eggplant pieces cut-side-down on the sheet; bake the eggplant in the oven for 45 minutes.  While eggplant is baking, grate half of the onion (you want the grated texture and intense flavor of the onion juice without the chopped texture) and chop the other half.  When the eggplant is done, take one half and simply scoop out the soft inner parts; the other half you want to cut into chunky cubes (you can leave the peel on or not- it's up to you- but i removed it); turn off the oven.  In a food processor, put half of the white beans, half of the chopped basil, the chopped onion (not the grated half), the garlic, half of the chopped scallions, and the half of the eggplant that you scooped out; whir the mixture until it is smooth.  Put the processed mixture in a crock pot and add the remaining ingredients (including the other half of the divided items), and heat on low for 2 hours; alternately you could simmer it on the stove for 30 minutes.  This is a very rich-tasting soup, so smallish servings can be a good idea."

The bag should look dark red.  Refrigerate for 1 - 4 hrs, the longer you wait the hotter they'll be.  Light the grill and while it's heating place shrimp on skewers.  When coals are very hot, clean the area that the shrimp will be on and rub with a bit of canola oil on a rag (use a mitt please).  Immediately place shrimp on greased grill for 2 - 3 minutes, turn and cook an additional 2 - 3 minutes.  Remove from skewers and serve hot.  No dipping sauce required.  This rub works well on chicken wings too!."

After washing them for two times, let them inside cold water and add some ice cubes.  Put them on a kitchen towel (occupy half of the towel).  Cover them with the other half of the kitchen towel and press with your hands to dry them all well.  Put them on an oven pan covered with parchment paper trying not to overlay them too much.  Add some dry herbs if you like and spray extra virgin olive oil.  Bake until colored.  Add salt after taking them out of the oven."

        "text": " couple of pounds of Halibut  enough cooking oil to allow deep frying  1 cup flour  one 12-ounce bottle of  beer  1 tbsp Of paprika and 1 1/2 tsp  salt  For this batter, good quality, light-colored beers work best.  The flavor of dark beers is too strong.  Cut Halibut into 1-inch-thick chunks.  Heat oil in a deep-fat fryer to 375 degF.  Make batter by combining remaining ingredients.  Dip the Halibut into the batter and drop the pieces into the hot oil a few at a time.  Cook the fish chunks until the batter is golden brown ~ just a few minutes.  Halibut overcooks easily, so try not to overdo it.  Remove the fish pieces from the oil and drain on paper towels; serve piping hot with your favorite accompaniments."

Put a pot of water to boil.  Once boiling, salt the water and add the pasta.  Cook until the pasta is al dente.  Set aside.  While the pasta is cooking, pour the milk in a microwave safe bowl and pop in the microwave for about 1 minute.  Set aside.  Meanwhile, in another saucepot, melt the butter over low heat.  Add in the garlic and crushed red pepper.  Cook for a minute or so.  Slowly add in the flour while whisking to ensure that there are no lumps.  Cook for about 1-2 minutes.  Gradually add the milk and keep whisking because the mixture will thicken quickly until all the milk is added.  Keep whisking until the flour/butter is mixed completely into the milk and there are no lumps.  Add in the 2 1/2 tsp of salt, 1 tsp of ground black pepper, oregano, parsley, and the cream cheese.  Cook over medium heat until the mixture has thickened.  While the sauce is thickening, saute the onions and mushrooms over medium heat with a little olive oil for about 3-4 minutes.  Add the spinach to the pan and season with 1/2 tsp salt and a pinch black pepper.  Continue to cook until the spinach has wilted.  Add in the chopped tomatoes and cook for another minute.  Add in the sauteed vegetables into the cream and stir.  Add in the pasta and stir until the pasta is evenly coated.  Pour into a large greased baking pan, cover with foil and cook for 20 minutes.  Remove from the oven and top with the mozzarella cheese and cherry tomatoes."
