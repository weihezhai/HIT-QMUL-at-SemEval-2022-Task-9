Saute pumpkin in hot olive oil for 3 minutes.  Set aside and let cool.  Mix feta and mozzarella; add, one at a time, eggs.  Mix and combine.  Add pumpkin and spices, mix well until well blended.  Evenly spoon the mixture into the greased muffin tin molds.  Press pizza dough down evenly and firmly (the pressing down firmly is very important to make sure they stick together).  Place in the oven and bake for 30 minutes at 200'C.  Remove the pizza bites from the oven and let set until cool (this is also very important - let the pizza bites set in their pan for 5 - 10 minutes before removing - if you take them out while they are too hot they will break)."

Put a pot of water to boil.  Once boiling, salt the water and add the pasta.  Cook until the pasta is al dente.  Set aside.  While the pasta is cooking, pour the milk in a microwave safe bowl and pop in the microwave for about 1 minute.  Set aside.  Meanwhile, in another saucepot, melt the butter over low heat.  Add in the garlic and crushed red pepper.  Cook for a minute or so.  Slowly add in the flour while whisking to ensure that there are no lumps.  Cook for about 1-2 minutes.  Gradually add the milk and keep whisking because the mixture will thicken quickly until all the milk is added.  Keep whisking until the flour/butter is mixed completely into the milk and there are no lumps.  Add in the 2 1/2 tsp of salt, 1 tsp of ground black pepper, oregano, parsley, and the cream cheese.  Cook over medium heat until the mixture has thickened.  While the sauce is thickening, saute the onions and mushrooms over medium heat with a little olive oil for about 3-4 minutes.  Add the spinach to the pan and season with 1/2 tsp salt and a pinch black pepper.  Continue to cook until the spinach has wilted.  Add in the chopped tomatoes and cook for another minute.  Add in the sauteed vegetables into the cream and stir.  Add in the pasta and stir until the pasta is evenly coated.  Pour into a large greased baking pan, cover with foil and cook for 20 minutes.  Remove from the oven and top with the mozzarella cheese and cherry tomatoes."

For cooking vegetables it's a good method, as it leaves you clean grilled taste A charcoal grill may end up overpowering the dish with a smoky flavor.  Slice the zucchini into 1/2 inch discs.  Get a good sized piece of tinfoil.  Spray it with a non-stick spray.  Add the zucchini, tomatoes, garlic, oil, salt and pepper.  Toss all the ingredients together, I use my clean hands, or use tongs.  Try not to rip the tinfoil in the process!  Bring the left and right edges of the tinfoil together and fold them together, two or three times, to seal .  Now fold the top and bottom edges together to created a nicely sealed packet.  The sealed packet will make the veggies all steam together nicely.  Turn the grill down to medium.  Put the packet on the grill, cover, and cook for 10 minutes.  With a spatula or tongs, turn the packet over and cook an additional 10 minutes.  After those ten minutes, open the packet and top with feta and mint.

Beat in the cognac, very slowly and put the mixture into a double saucepan.  Heat gently, whisking all the time until the advocaat is warm (not hot) and thick.  Remove the pan from the heat and stir in the vanilla essence.  Pour into a jug.  advocaat is served in a glass and eaten with a teaspoon.  It can also be topped with whipped cream.  Also, might i add, that advocaat is nothing like the eggnog here in America.  It is thick and creamy - not foamy at all."

Very slowly pour in the brandy, but keep on beating the mixture.  Pour the mix into a heavy saucepan and heat gently, whisking constantly until the advocaat is warm (not hot) and thick.  Remove from the heat and pour into a clean bottle.  The advocaat should be thick enough to scoop with a spoon to eat.  It usually is served with whipped cream.  Despite its appearance, advocaat is viewed as a beverage."

Bring to a boil and then remove from the heat.  Let it stand for about 15 minutes.  Combine sugar and egg yolks in a medium bowl and beat with a whisk till yolks become a pale yellow color  SLOWLY add the cream mixture, stirring constantly.  Not too quick or you'll have scrambled eggs.  Pour mixture into 6 6-7 oz ramekins that are placed in a roasting pan.  Once poured, transfer to a 325 degree oven and add hot water to 1/2 way up the ramekin for the water bath.  Let bake till the outsides of the custard become firm but the middle is still jiggly, about 45 min.  Put in the fridge till ready to eat, remove and let set for 10-15 minutes before using a torch to melt the sugar topping!  Some people just like a tad bit of sugar, and some like the full teaspoon!  However much you like, please make sure your container of brulee is safe to go under the broiler if you don't have a tiny torch!  I usually use 1/2 tsp of sugar for Loved One's pot o' Creme!"

Butter a 20 cm (9 inch) cake tin.  Blend sweet potato, butter, eggs, sugar, baking soda, salt and cinnamon in a food processor until smooth.  Stir in yoghurt and cornmeal and pour into greased, lined tin.  Bake for 45 minutes in preheated oven, or until a fine skewer comes out clean.  Cool a little before turning out.  Cut into squares to serve with meat and salad.  Cold cornbread can be fried quickly on both sides and served as a base for grilled meat.  It is possible to substitute pumpkin for sweet potato, but it must be a dry pumpkin."

Fresh Strawberries  Sugar To Taste (optional - berries vary from year to year. If they're really sweet you many not need any but if you want the syrupy nectar to drizzle over the top you'll need to mix in some sugar as that draws out the natural fruit juice)  1 to 2 oz strawberry rum  Light whipped creme, Cool whip (French Vanilla flavor is super yummy) vanilla or strawberry ice cream (whichever you prefer)  Preheat oven to 325.  Spray a tube pan with Pam Cooking Spray.  Rub in with fingers especially if using a fluted pan.  You want to make sure that all the surface is coated so the cake won't stick.  Cream butter well.  Gradually add sugar and blend until smooth.  Add eggs one at a time, beating after each addition.  Add sour cream and mix well.  Beat in flour.  Then add flavoring.  Pour into pan and bake for 60 to 75 minutes or until a cake tester comes out clean.  Leave in pan for 10 minutes.  Then remove to a cooling rack.  As with any cake you're supposed to allow it to cool before slicing but I love a piece when the top is slightly crusty and the inside is soft,warm and that vanilla, buttery aroma steams up to your nose with each bite!  In your kitchen you make and break the rules.  Just enjoy!  For the topping, slice strawberries.  Sprinkle with sugar.  Pour in rum.  Stir and let sit for 1 to 2 hours so juices release and alcohol soaks into he berries.  Slice cake layers.  Top with strawberries and whipped creme!"

Blend tofu, vanilla extract, and lime juice in a processor or blender until creamy and smooth.  Add the rest of the ingredients except crust and blend again until smooth.  At this point, transfer the mixture to a bowl and beat on high speed with an electric mixer.  Pour the mixture into the crust and chill 2-3 hours or until firm.  This sets up very firm.  It also makes a great pudding or little tartlet filling for fancy desserts.  Serve cold and plain or with other desserts."

As well, while shopping at the Japanese Grocery store I saw vacuum packed Tempura which are ready to fry.  I bought this on a lark to see the taste and when fried a la minute (to order) it was really tasty.  Remember frying oil must be between 300-350 to get the crispiness quickly so that your Tempura does not soak up the oil  ***I have a fear of tapeworm - an illogical fear.  Before I make any uncooked fish at home whether for Sashimi or Sushi I freeze my fish overnight or longer.  Then I defrost it and use it raw.  The freezing kills the Parasites that cause tapeworm.

Close lid & flip it back after about 4-5mins.  Fish is completely cooked if your fork goes thru the meat easily.  Remove & top with the 3 types of chilli & you'll get a tender fish dish with crispy skin!

It should be thick enough to cover the back of a wooden spoon but easy to pour.  Set aside covered to keep warm.  Preheat oven to 375deg.  Salt and pepper generously the pork chops.  In a large skillet over medium high heat add the oil.  When hot add the chops and sear them on each side.  2minutes each sides.  Remove from the stove and place in the hot oven.  Cook for 3 minutes at 375deg then lower the heat to 300deg for another 5 minutes.  The chops need to be springy to the touch and golden brown on the outside."

Toss one-fourth of mixture on a floured board and roll as thinly as possible; shape with a small round cutter, first dipped in flour.  Place near together on a buttered sheet and bake in a moderate oven.  Gather up the trimmings and roll with another portion of dough.  During rolling, the bowl containing mixture should be kept in a cool place, or it will be necessary to add more flour to dough, which makes cookies hard rather than crisp and short."

Mix very well, add baking powder and flour, stir well, then add coconut shred and chocolate chips (or oatmeal).  Preheat the stove at 350F. Form the cookies with a tablespoon and fingers. (  Remember that they will grow 2-3 sizes larger, so leave enough space between your cookies).  Bake for 20-25 minutes until golden brown.  ***Tip from Helen*** If you don't want your cookies to be very-very sweet add 1 cup of sugar.  If you want your cookies to be more soft add less flour and bake them for 20 minutes until light golden brown.***  Tip from Helen***  Enjoy!"

Yogurt maker of your choice.  -Buy Stonyfield organic pain yogurt.  You will only need 2 tablespoons so freeze the rest or just eat it.  The Stonyfield has the most good bacteria I could find.  -Buy Stonyfield fat free organic milk, half gallon.  You can buy full fat.  I buy the fat free because it has less calories.  -Heat the milk in a sterilized saucepan over medium heat until it reaches 180 degrees.  This will kill bad bacteria.  This takes about 10 minutes.  Cool the milk down to 110 degrees.  -In a sterile glass bowl or measuring cup, add the two tablespoons of organic yogurt and some of the milk.  Mix until combined and then add back to the milk that is in the saucepan.  Mix well.  -Add water to your yogurt maker.  There should be a water line inside.  Fill water to that line.  -Strain your milk mixture right into the yogurt maker and let it go for 10 to 14 hours.  That is usually how long I let mine go for.  I strain my cooled milk just in case there is some milk that cooked.  -After your yogurt is done immediately put in the fridge and cool for a couple hours.  Once your yogurt is cooled, eat or strain.  I always strain my yogurt because I like it thick.  I put a coffee filter in a strainer, add some yogurt and strain for an hour or so.  This will have to be done in steps.  Once strained add to a sterilized glass dish and add any flavoring.  I would not add berries or anything like that until you are ready to eat.  -Don't forget to take out a couple tablespoons of your homemade yogurt before you flavor it.  You need to save that as a yogurt starter for the next batch you make.  Every time I do make yogurt I boil water in my saucepan to sterilize it and then add the boiling water to the container I make the yogurt in, so that is sterilized too.  Make sure your thermometer is sterilized in the boiling water.  Dry with a clean paper towel before you add your milk to the saucepan and to the yogurt maker."

(  The two cannot touch at this stage as they will counter each other, and your dough will not rise.)  Cover each with a little flour.  Make a well in the middle and add warm water and oil.  Mix well with a table knife to incorporate the dough.  Transfer to a clean surface and knead until smooth.  This will take around 4-6 minutes.  Dust some flour to the board to eliminate sticking to it.  Brush the surface of the dough with a little olive oil and placed on a clean oiled bowl.  Cover with saran wrap and let it rise in a warm place until it doubles in size, about 1 hour.  Grease a large baking tray.  Scoop gently the dough from the bowl and place it onto the prepared baking tray.  Flatten gently the dough to shape into a rectangle and spray or brush lightly with more oil.  Cover with saran wrap, as before, and leave in a warm place for 30 minutes or until doubled in size.  Preheat the oven to 400F.  Slightly press the surface with your fingers to create small pockets.  Sprinkle with fresh rosemary, abundant sea salt flakes.  Drizzle with more olive oil.  Bake for 25 to 30 minutes, or until golden brown and cooked through.

(  Ensure the entire dish is coated, as the marshmallow mixture is very sticky.  Combine 1/2 cup of powdered sugar with 1/4 cup cornstarch.  Sift mixture into the baking dish and shake so the dish is coated.  Set aside.  In a large bowl combine gelatin, vanilla extract, and maple extract with 1/2 cup and 2 tablespoons of cold water.  Gently whisk mixture until well combined and no lumps remain.  Continue to whisk until the gelatin reaches a consistency similar to baby food (about one minute).  Set aside.  In a medium saucepan combine 3/4 cup water, corn syrup, granulated sugar, and salt.  Whisk to combine and bring to a boil over medium high heat.  Cover pot, reduce heat and simmer for about 2 and a half minutes.  Remove from heat.  Pour mixture over gelatin and beat on medium with an electric mixer until combined, about one minute.  Increase speed to maximum and beat for 15-20 minutes until the mixture is glossy and makes meringue like peaks.  Pour marshmallow mixture into prepared 9*13 inch dish and spread evenly.  Wet spatula and smooth the top until it's even.  Leave the marshmallow mixture uncovered on a counter for 24 hours to set.  Once the marshmallows have set, prepare your workspace.  Combine remaining powdered sugar and cornstarch in a medium sized bowl.  Dust some of the mixture onto a cutting board.  Wet a sharp knife and drag it along the edges of the 9*13 inch dish to loosen the marshmallow mixture.  Sprinkle some of the powdered sugar onto the top of the marshmallows and flip the dish onto prepared cutting board.  Cut the marshmallows into squares, occasionally wetting the knife to make more precise cuts.  Toss marshmallow squares in the cornstarch sugar mixture until well coated.  Store marshmallows in a sealed container, layered between wax paper."

Take your cauliflower, cut the leaves, wash it and put aside.  Set a saucepan with water (that will be able to fit in your cauliflower) on medium gas and as soon as the water will start boiling put your cauliflower in it for 5-7 minutes.  Your cauliflower should be soft, but a little bit crunchy.  ***Tip from Helen*** Boiling reduces the levels of these compounds, with losses of 20-30% after five minutes, 40-50% after ten minutes, and 75% after thirty minutes.[14] However, other preparation methods, such as steaming, microwaving, and stir frying, had no significant effect on the compounds ***Tip from Helen***  Drain the water and let the cauliflower cool off.  After it cooled off cut the cauliflower into flowerets (if they are big you can cut them in halves).  Take an egg, beat it up with water and add the flower.  Season the cauliflower, add salt and pepper to the egg-water-flour mix.  Set a frying pan on medium gas, add cooking oil; coat the cauliflower in egg-water-flower mix and fry on each side until golden brown.  Your cauliflower is ready, it's good warn and when it's cold from the fridge, it's good with dips.  Enjoy!"

Cut the ends off the eggplant then cut the eggplant lengthwise.  Spray a baking sheet with cooking spray and lay the eggplant pieces cut-side-down on the sheet; bake the eggplant in the oven for 45 minutes.  While eggplant is baking, grate half of the onion (you want the grated texture and intense flavor of the onion juice without the chopped texture) and chop the other half.  When the eggplant is done, take one half and simply scoop out the soft inner parts; the other half you want to cut into chunky cubes (you can leave the peel on or not- it's up to you- but i removed it); turn off the oven.  In a food processor, put half of the white beans, half of the chopped basil, the chopped onion (not the grated half), the garlic, half of the chopped scallions, and the half of the eggplant that you scooped out; whir the mixture until it is smooth.  Put the processed mixture in a crock pot and add the remaining ingredients (including the other half of the divided items), and heat on low for 2 hours; alternately you could simmer it on the stove for 30 minutes.  This is a very rich-tasting soup, so smallish servings can be a good idea."

Cook the soba noodles according to the package directions, being careful not to overcook - you want them on the firmer side.  Drain, then rinse very thoroughly with cold water until all traces of starchiness are gone, and drain again. (  It helps to gently swish the noodles around a bit with your hands as the water runs over them.)  Gently combine the noodles, dressing, avocado, jalapeno, mango, mint and scallions.
