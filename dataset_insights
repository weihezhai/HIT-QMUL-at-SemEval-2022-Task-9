Question IDs are question types, then there are in total 19 kind of classes in the dataset. (26252 pairs in total)

0: How many actions does it take to …...? (asnwers need part/ DROP / RESULT col)/ how many things are used? (answers are always 1) /how many times ...?
    (Need reasoning,
   no exact match with context) Update: can be done with coreference tags and DROP_ tags. 
   answer with magnitude more than 4 can be misleading.

1: what should be ……? ()

2: how do you mix / where should you ? answers are tools and habitats (some tools and habitats are hidden but are labelled as cooking roles in the dataset) 
   when answering 'where' question, only habitat tag would be used, (exact match)
   when answering 'how' problem, answer starts with 'by using a' and then tool and other infomation would be used. 

3: Mixture related questions, usually start with what’s in the <RESULT>? or how did you get the <RESULT>? 
  (Answers cannot be answered directly from context and reasoning, it should come from CRL.)
  {span prediction }'how' question could be answered by using easy generating method as the answer are simply some words plus some easy grammar.
    'by' + Ving + the + things + (in/on/at somewhere) + (with + tools).
  {multispan extraction} 'what' question could be answered without generation but just span extraction and put them in order (no order pattern found).
  
4: first / second event selection. Based on the EVENT tags and order. There should be more than two entities in the question, but exactly two EVENTs exist.

5: To what extend do you……? (answers exact match with context)

6: how do you …. ? answers always include B-instrument.

7: for how long do you …? Answers usually from B-Time tagged text.

8: where do you do the action…? Answer from B-Habitat and B-destination labelled text.

9: (145) By how much do you do the action ? Answer from B-Extent (only a few of questions are from this type (145 questions of them)).

10: (2000) How do you ….? Compared to the 6th type of question, the 10th need B-attribute label (works like ADV.) from CRL labels to answer the question.

11: Why do you ….? Only 11 questions are from this type. Answers are text with B-Cause tags.

12: (300) where do you …? Answer often with ADP

13: (50) what do you do action with? Where do you …? Answers are with  B-Co-Theme tags.

14: (190) How do you … ? Answer with B-Goal tags

15: (300) why do you … ? answer with B-purpose

16: (200) From where do you …? Answer from B-Source

17: (1300) where was the thing before it was done the action? Answer can be found by looking at the first B-Habitat labelled text before the B-Event verb directly after the ‘before’ word.

18: (2600) N/A



2.	Observations: 
1)	Lots of ingredients are not useful, almost none of questions are about them. Maybe padding them with the ingredient tag.
2)	Need CRL embedding
3). N/A comes just from randomly mix one question from other recipe with current one.
